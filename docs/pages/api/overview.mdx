# Enzyme API - Overview

The Enzyme API is a gRPC API.

In order to use the Enzyme API, you will need an API key. API keys can be generated within the Enzyme App, https://app.enzyme.finance/account/api-tokens

The Enzyme API gathers information from various datasources:
- Enzyme Subgraphs
- On-chain data
- Various off-chain datasources managed by Enzyme Finance (e.g. vault descriptions and vault performance data)

## Quick Start

Enzyme provides an API client package [@enzymefinance/api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@enzymefinance/api) which you can import into your JavaScript/TypeScript project. The client package runs both in the browser and in a node.js environment.

```bash
pnpm add @enzymefinance/api
```

Client packages for other languages can be downloaded directly from the Buf Schema Registry at https://buf.build/avantgardefinance/enzyme/assets/main

We have built two simple examples on how to use the Enzyme client packages to get you started:

- Example browser usage: https://github.com/enzymefinance/sdk/tree/main/examples/example-api-web
- Example node usage: https://github.com/enzymefinance/sdk/tree/main/examples/example-api-node

If you cannot make use of the API client package, you can also send standard HTTP requests. A sample request looks as follows:

```bash
curl -X POST \
-H "content-type: application/json" \
-H "authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
-H "connect-protocol-version: 1" \
-d '{"address": "0x1b83ba4527c837d462d5b78d65a097dabae5ea89"}' \
