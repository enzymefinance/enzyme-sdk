# Network

The Enzyme API provides various endpoints to obtain data related to the network of all Enzyme vaults.

- [GetVaultList](https://buf.build/avantgardefinance/enzyme/docs/main:enzyme.enzyme.v1#enzyme.enzyme.v1.EnzymeService.GetVaultList): list of all vaults deployed on Enzyme
- [GetNetworkTimeSeries](https://buf.build/avantgardefinance/enzyme/docs/main:enzyme.enzyme.v1#enzyme.enzyme.v1.EnzymeService.GetNetworkTimeSeries): aggregated timeseries for all vaults (e.g. aggregated NAV)
- [GetNetworkFeeStatistics](https://buf.build/avantgardefinance/enzyme/docs/main:enzyme.enzyme.v1#enzyme.enzyme.v1.EnzymeService.GetNetworkFeeStatistics): network fee statistics
