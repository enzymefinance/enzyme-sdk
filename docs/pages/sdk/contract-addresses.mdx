# Contract Addresses

In order to use the Enzyme SDK, you will need addresses of certain contracts (depending on the interaction).

## General Addresses

Addresses for the Enzyme deployments are available here:

- [Ethereum](https://docs.enzyme.finance/developers/contracts/mainnet)
- [Polygon](https://docs.enzyme.finance/developers/contracts/polygon)


## Vault-Specific Addresses

To interact with a specific vault, you will need two contract addresses that define the vault:

- **VaultProxy**:  this is the main unchangable smart contract for a vault. You can best find the address of the VaultProxy in the URL of the Enzyme app.
- **ComptrollerProxy**: this is the secondary, changable smart contract for a vault. 
  It is different for each release and for each reconfiguration within a release. 
  You can best find it by going to the VaultProxy in the network explorer, and then call the `getAccessor` function. 
 Alternatively, you can obtain it from the `GetVault` endpoint with the Enzyme API.

Since both the VaultProxy and the ComptrollerProxy are proxy contracts, you might need to use the "Is this a proxy?" function in the network explorer.
