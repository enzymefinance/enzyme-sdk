# Reconfigure a Vault

A vault can be reconfigured within a given release. During a reconfiguration, fees and/or policies can be added and/or removed.

Vault reconfiguration is a two-step process:
1. Create a reconfiguration request
2. Execute the reconfiguration (after a waiting period of 7 days)

## 1. Create a Reconfiguration request


```ts
import { LifeCycle } from "@enzymefinance/sdk";

const reconfiguration = LifeCycle.createReconfigurationRequest({
    vaultProxy,
    denominationAsset,
    sharesActionTimelockInSeconds,
    feeManagerConfigData,
    policyManagerConfigData,
});

await walletClient.sendTransaction(reconfiguration.params);
```

| Parameter | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `vaultProxy` | Address of the vaultProxy |

The remaining reconfiguration request parameters are identical to the [parameters used to create a new vault](/sdk/vault-lifecycle/create-new).


## 2. Execute the Reconfiguration

A reconfiguration request can be executed after a waiting period of 7 days.

```ts
import { LifeCycle } from "@enzymefinance/sdk";

const execute = LifeCyle.executeReconfiguration({
    fundDeployer,
    vaultProxy
});

await walletClient.sendTransaction(execute.params);
```

## Cancel Reconfiguration

In case needed, a reconfiguration can also be cancelled.

```ts
import { LifeCycle } from "@enzymefinance/sdk";

const cancel = LifeCyle.cancelReconfiguration({
    fundDeployer,
    vaultProxy
});

await walletClient.sendTransaction(cancel.params);
```
