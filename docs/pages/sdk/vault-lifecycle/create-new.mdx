# Create a New Vault

When you create a new vault, you need to set the configuration of the vault. Most parameters are straight-forward.  

For more details on the various configuration options, see [Setup and Configure Your Vault](https://docs.enzyme.finance/managers/setup)

```ts
import { LifeCycle } from "@enzymefinance/sdk";

const create = LifeCycle.createVault({
    fundDeployer,
    owner,
    name,
    symbol,
    denominationAsset,
    sharesActionTimelockInSeconds,
    feeManagerConfigData,
    policyManagerConfigData,
});

await walletClient.sendTransaction(create.params);

```

| Parameter | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `fundDeployer` | Address of the current FundDeployer contract (see [Contract Addresses](/sdk/contract-addresses.mdx)) |
| `owner` | Address of the vault owner. This usually is the same address as the sender of the transaction, however, it can also be different. |
| `name` | The name of the vault |
| `symbol` | The symbol of the vault |
| `denominationAsset` | Address of the denomination asset |
| `sharesActionTimelockInSeconds` | Timelock for redemptions (in seconds) |
| `feeManagerConfigData` | Fee configuration of the vault (see below) |
| `policyManagerConfigData` | Policy configuration of the vault (see below) |


## Policy configuration

A vault can use policies if desired. Policies typically have configuration parameters. 
For the addresses of the individual policies, see [Contract Addresses](/sdk/contract-addresses.mdx).

```ts
import { Policy, Policies } from "@enzymefinance/sdk";

const policy1Config = Policies.MinMaxInvestment.encodeSettings({
    minInvestmentAmount,
    maxInvestmentAmount
});

const policy2Config =
    Policies.CumulativeSlippageTolerance.encodeSettings({
        slippageTolerance
    }
);

const feeManagerConfigData = Policy.encodeSettings([
    {
        address: minMaxInvestmentPolicyAddress,
        settings: policy1Config
    },
    {
        address: cumulativeSlippageTolerancePolicyAddress,
        settings: policy2Config
    },
]);
```

## Fee configuration

A vault can use fees if desired. Fees typically have configuration parameters. 
For the addresses of the individual fees, see [Contract Addresses](/sdk/contract-addresses.mdx).

```ts
import { Fee, Fees } from "@enzymefinance/sdk";

const fee1Config = Fees.Management.encodeSettings({
    perAnnumRate,
});

const fee2Config = Fees.Performance.encodeSettings({
    rateInBps
});

const feeManagerConfigData = Fee.encodeSettings([
    {
        address: managementFeeAddress,
        settings: fee1Config
    },
    {
        address: performanceFeeAddress,
        settings: fee2Config
    },
]);
```
