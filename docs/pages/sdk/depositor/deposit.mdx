# Deposit into an Enzyme vault

Depositing into an Enzyme vault is a two step process:
1. Approve the ComptrollerProxy of the vault to spend a certain amount of denomination asset tokens
2. Send a deposit transaction to the ComptrollerProxy.

## 1. Approve spending

```ts 
import { Asset } from "@enzymefinance/sdk";
import { parseUnits } from "viem";

const approve = Asset.approve({ 
    asset: denominationAsset, 
    amount: parseUnits("1", 18), 
    spender: comptrollerProxy
});

await walletClient.sendTransaction(approve.params);
```

## 2. Deposit

Depositing the approved amount into the vault.

```ts
import { Depositor } from "@enzymefinance/sdk";
import { parseUnits } from "viem";

const deposit = Depositor.deposit({
    comptrollerProxy,
    amount: parseUnits("1", 18),
    depositor,
    minSharesvQuantity: 1n,
})

await walletClient.sendTransaction(deposit.params);

```

### Expected Number of Shares

For simplicity, we have set `minSharesQuantity` to 1 wei shares above. In real life, you should set it to a more realistic amount. 

The expected number of shares for a given deposit can be obtained with the `getExpectedSharesForDeposit` function, and then allowing for some slippage (e.g. 1%).

```ts
import { Depositor } from "@enzymefinance/sdk";

const expectedNumberOfShares = Depositor.getExpectedSharesForDeposit(
    publicClient, 
    {
        comptrollerProxy,
        amount: parseUnits("1", 18),
        depositor,
    }
);

const minSharesQuantity = expectedNumberOfShares * 99 / 100;
```
