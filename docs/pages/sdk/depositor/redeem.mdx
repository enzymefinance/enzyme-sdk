# Reedem Shares

There are two kind of redemptions:
- Specific Assets Redemptions: the depositor receives the value of their shares in one or several assets
- In-kind redemptions: the depositor receives a slice of all assets in the vault

## Specific Assets Redemption

```ts
import { Depositor } from "@enzymefinance/sdk";

const redemption = Depositor.redeemSharesForSpecificAssets({
    comptrollerProxy,
    recipient,
    sharesQuantity,
    payoutAssets,
    payoutPercentages,
});

await walletClient.sendTransaction(redemption.params);
```

| Parameter | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `comptrollerProxy` | Address of comptrollerProxy |
| `recipient` | Address of the recipient of the redemption. Typically, this is the depositor. |
| `sharesQuantity` | Number of shares (18 decimals) |
| `payoutAssets` | List of asset addresses |
| `payoutPercentages` | List of payout percentages (in bps) |


## In-Kind Redemption


```ts
import { Depositor } from "@enzymefinance/sdk";

const redemption = Depositor.redeemSharesInKind({
    comptrollerProxy,
    recipient,
    sharesQuantity,
    additionalAssets,
    assetsToSkip,
});

await walletClient.sendTransaction(redemption.params);
```

| Parameter | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `comptrollerProxy` | Address of comptrollerProxy |
| `recipient` | Address of the recipient of the redemption. Typically, this is the depositor. |
| `sharesQuantity` | Number of shares (18 decimals) |
| `additionalAssets` | List of additional asset addresses (i.e. assets that the vault owns, but that are not tracked by the vault)|
| `assetsToSkip` | List of assets to skip (e.g. because they cannot be transferred) |

:::warning
In-kind redemptions should only be used for vaults without external positions. External positions cannot be split up, 
and depositors will therefore not receive their pro-rate share of an external position.
