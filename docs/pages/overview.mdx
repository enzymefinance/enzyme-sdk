# Overview

The Enzyme API and the Enzyme SDK allow you to interact with the Enzyme protocol.

## Enzyme API

The Enzyme API provides endpoints to _read_ data related to Enzyme vaults, e.g.

- NAV and current share price,
- Portfolio,
- Historical share prices.

## Enzyme SDK

The Enzyme SDK is a TypeScript library that allows you to interact with the Enzyme protocol on-chain, e.g.

- Deposit into a vault,
- Swap assets,
- Reconfigure a vault.
